    <i> A <strong>girl</strong> from the Phillipines.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>A soon-to-be 21 year old, but for some reason assumes herself to be 23, Angel is a student nurse pursuing BSc in Nursing. She is lovable, a hard worker, a Dean's Lister to be exact and a great cook but she can be a kid and very careless at times. Yes, this is being typed by her boyfriend duh. Her catchphrase is <strong>;</strong>. She said she's lazy so I'm adding that too.</i>
